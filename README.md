# Bootleg

A browser extension that brings the joy of physical media to internet video.
Currently, Bootleg supports Vine videos (both embeds and vine.co video pages.)

## TODO

* Better readme
* Add support for more video services
* Package extension and release to Chrome Store
* Better support for the vine.co homepage, profile pages, etc.
* Change the poster so it's clear when a video's too worn to play
